# Gemini-LaTeXOCR

An intelligent OCR tool based on Google Gemini, automatically recognizing mathematical formulas from the clipboard and generating precise LaTeX/Markdown code to facilitate efficient academic note-taking.

---

## üìñ Introduction

To address the inefficiency of converting complex mathematical formulas and mixed text into LaTeX code, this tool is developed using the **Gemini-2.0-flash** model. Key advantages include:
- **Real-time Clipboard Monitoring**: Automatically recognizes screenshots (toggleable) without manual intervention.
- **High Accuracy**: Optimized for complex structures like matrices, equations, and formulas.
- **Cross-Format Compatibility**: Output code supports `.tex` and `.md`, ready for one-click copying.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:  
- **Windows only**. Requires a stable internet connection to access Gemini API.
- A free API Key from Google AI Studio is required ([see setup guide](#-installation--configuration)).

## üñ• Usage

### Mode 1: Clipboard Recognition (Recommended)
1. Capture the formula/text area using a screenshot tool (e.g., Snipaste).
2. Copy the image to clipboard (`Ctrl+C`).
3. The program auto-detects and generates code, displayed in the main interface.
4. Click "Copy Result" to paste directly into your document.

### Mode 2: Manual Upload
1. Click "Select File" to upload a local image.
2. Wait for recognition. Results are displayed and ready to copy.

### Settings
- **Clipboard Monitoring**: Toggle via the gear icon.
- **Temporary File Cleanup**: Cache images are automatically deleted after recognition.

**Output Code**:
```latex
Theorem 5 If the homogeneous linear system
$$
\begin{cases}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \dots + a_{1n}x_n = 0, \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \dots + a_{2n}x_n = 0, \\
\vdots \\
a_{n1}x_1 + a_{n2}x_2 + \dots + a_{nn}x_n = 0
\end{cases}
$$
has a coefficient matrix with non-zero determinant \(|A| \neq 0\), then it has only the trivial solution.
